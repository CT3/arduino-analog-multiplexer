This library is used in order to abstract away a few of the details to do
with analog multiplexing and demultiplexing. It assumes the following:

- The multiplexer is analog and is compatible with the 4051 type (ie: 8 analog
inputs or outputs, selected by setting HIGH/LOW on 3 digital input pins for 3
bit resolution and an input selection pin active LOW)

- At this point the library assumes that the IO selector is set high or low by
your program code. In most instances it's typical to set the component for
either input or output not flipping back and forth. This will be resolved in
a later version.

See: http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/4051 for more details about
the component itself and basic usage.

To use the library simply put it on your compile path and include... etc

TODO: Write examples harness and to document the usage instructions properly
TODO: Make code a little less repetitive
TODO: Make the code deal with switching between MUX and DEMUX properly
